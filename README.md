## üë®‚Äçüíª How to Contribute to Existing Projects

Joining an existing project is one of the best ways to learn and collaborate. We follow a standard open-source workflow.

1.  **Find a Project:** Browse our repositories. Look for issues tagged `good first issue` or `help wanted` if you're new.
2.  **Fork the Repository:** Click the **"Fork"** button on the project's page. This creates a copy of the repository under your personal GitHub account. 
3.  **Clone Your Fork:** On your computer, run `git clone` to download a copy of *your fork*.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git]
    ```
4.  **Create a Branch:** Always work on a new branch to keep your changes separate.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b your-branch-name (should define your contribution)
    ```
5.  **Make & Commit Changes:** Write your code, fix the bug, or improve documentation. When you're done, commit your work with a clear message.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Briefly describe your new feature or fix"
    ```
6.  **Push to Your Fork:** Push your new branch up to your forked repository on GitHub.
    ```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```
7.  **Open a Pull Request (PR):** Go to the original university repository. GitHub will show a prompt to create a Pull Request from your new branch. Fill out the PR template, explain your changes, and submit it for review!
