## 👨‍💻 Want to Contribute? Here's How!

Joining an existing project is one of the best ways to learn and make an impact. We use the standard open-source workflow, and it’s easier than you think.

1.  **Find a Project:** Browse our repositories. If you're new, look for issues tagged `good first issue`—they're a great place to start.

2.  **Fork the Repo:** Click the **"Fork"** button on the project's page. This creates your own personal copy. 

3.  **Clone It Locally:** Download your fork to your computer so you can work on it.
    ```bash
    # Get the link from the "Code" button on YOUR forked repo
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
    ```
4.  **Create a New Branch:** Always make your changes on a new branch. Give it a descriptive name!
    ```bash
    git checkout -b your-feature-name
    ```
5.  **Make Your Magic:** Write your code, fix that bug, or improve the documentation. When you're done, save your changes.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Briefly describe your awesome change"
    ```
6.  **Push Your Work:** Send your changes up to your fork on GitHub.
    ```bash
    git push origin your-feature-name
    ```
7.  **Open a Pull Request (PR):** Head back to the original repository. You'll see a prompt to open a PR. Write a clear title and description, and you're all set. We'll take it from there!
